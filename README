Dropbox is an awesome tool, regardless being a shared repository for working on collaborative projects or simply backup up some documents.

However in cases where one would like to synchronize large amounts of files across multiple local PCs, it does not make sense to have a 50GB limit. Hard drives are cheap, and it will be cool to enhance dropbox to take care of larger amounts of data. 

In this project we aim to provide multiple PCs running dropbox to locally synchronize large amounts of data.

Milestones:
- Decap HTTP proxy (done)
- Decap HTTPS
- Examine, compare and document protocol stream
